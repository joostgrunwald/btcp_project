    """bTCP server socket
    A server application makes use of the services provided by bTCP by calling
    accept, recv, and close.

    You're implementing the transport layer, exposing it to the application
    layer as a (variation on) socket API. Do note, however, that this socket
    as presented is *always* in "listening" state, and handles the client's
    connection in the same socket. You do not have to implement a separate
    listen socket. If you get everything working, you may do so for some extra
    credit.

    To implement the transport layer, you also need to interface with the
    network (lossy) layer. This happens by both calling into it
    (LossyLayer.send_segment) and providing callbacks for it
    (BTCPServerSocket.lossy_layer_segment_received, lossy_layer_tick).

    Your implementation will operate in two threads, the network thread,
    where the lossy layer "lives" and where your callbacks will be called from,
    and the application thread, where the application calls connect, send, etc.
    This means you will need some thread-safe information passing between
    network thread and application thread.
    Writing a boolean or enum attribute in one thread and reading it in a loop
    in another thread should be sufficient to signal state changes.
    Lists, however, are not thread safe, so to pass data and segments around
    you probably want to use Queues, or a similar thread safe collection.

        If no data is available to return to the application, this method

        been terminated, this method should return with no data (e.g. an empty
        bytes b'').

        If you want, you can add an argument to this method stating how many
        bytes you want to receive in one go at the most (but this is not
        required for this project).

        You are free to implement this however you like, but the following
        explanation may help to understand how sockets *usually* behave and you
        may choose to follow this concept as well:

        The way this usually works is that "recv" operates on a "receive
        buffer". Once data has been successfully received and acknowledged by
        the transport layer, it is put "in the receive buffer". A call to recv
        will simply return data already in the receive buffer to the
        application.  If no data is available at all, the method will block
        until at least *some* data can be returned.
        The actual receiving of the data, i.e. reading the segments, sending
        acknowledgements for them, reordering them, etc., happens *outside* of
        the recv method (e.g. in the network thread).
        Because of this blocking behaviour, an *empty* result from recv signals
        that the connection has been terminated.

        Again, you should feel free to deviate from how this usually works.
