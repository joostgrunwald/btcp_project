"""This exposes a constant bytes object called TEST_BYTES_128MIB which, as the
name suggests, is 128 MiB in size. You can send it, receive it, and check it
for equality on the receiving end.

Pycharm may complain about an unresolved reference. This is a lie. It simply
cannot deal with a python source file this large so it cannot resolve the
reference. Python itself will run it fine, though.

You can also use the file large_input.py as-is for file transfer.

def btcp_file_transfer_client():
    """This method should implement your bTCP file transfer client. We have
    provided a bare bones implementation: a command line argument parser and
    a normal sequence of
    - create the client socket
    - connect
    - open the file
    - loop to send all data in the file
    - shutdown / disconnect
    - close

    If you start the server_app.py, and then this client_app.py, this will
    transfer the input file to the server process.

    Our rudimentary bTCP sockets already achieve this *on a perfect network*,
    because they just chunk the data into bTCP segments. You can check that
    input and output are the same by using the `cmp` command, e.g. for the
    default filenames:
        `cmp large_input.py output.file`
    If they are the same, no output is given.
    If they differ it will tell you the location of the first difference.

    But because there is no window size negotiation, no checksums, no sequence
    numbers, etc yet, the receiving queue might overflow, reordered segments
    end up as reordered data, flipped bits remain flipped, etc.

    If you need to change anything, feel free to use helper methods.
